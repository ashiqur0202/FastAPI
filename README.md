# FastAPI

## Introduction to FastAPI
- **What is FastAPI?**

  FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.
- **Features and Advantages**
  - **Fast:** FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available.
  - **Automatic API documentation:** FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation based on the standard OpenAPI specification.
  - **Type checking:** FastAPI uses standard Python type hints to validate request and response data at runtime.
  - **Dependency injection:** It provides a straightforward way to declare and inject dependencies into your endpoints.
  - **Asynchronous support:** It fully supports asynchronous programming, which can lead to high concurrency and scalability.
  - **Easy integration with databases:** FastAPI can easily integrate with popular databases like SQLAlchemy and Tortoise ORM.
- **Use Cases**
  - **API Development:** FastAPI is primarily used for building APIs, including RESTful APIs, WebSocket APIs, and GraphQL APIs.
  - **Microservices:** Due to its speed and asynchronous support, FastAPI is an excellent choice for building microservices architectures.
  - **Machine Learning APIs:** FastAPI's support for type hints and fast performance makes it a great choice for building machine learning APIs.
  - **Real-time applications:** With WebSocket support, FastAPI can be used to build real-time applications like chat applications, stock tickers, and live dashboards.


## Getting Started with FastAPI

### 1. Installation

### Using pip:
- Install FastAPI: `pip install fastapi`

### 2. Creating your first FastAPI application
- Create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) in your preferred text editor.
- Import FastAPI: `from fastapi import FastAPI`
- Create an instance of FastAPI: `app = FastAPI()`
- Define your first endpoint:
  ```python
  @app.get("/")
  def read_root():
      return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}

### 3. Running the application

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is saved.

3. Use Uvicorn to run your FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload

1. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser to see the output.

2. You should see the message "Hello, FastAPI!" displayed on the webpage.


## Basic Concepts

1. **Routes and Endpoints:**

    - Routes in FastAPI are created using the `@app.get`, `@app.post`, `@app.put`, `@app.delete` decorators. Each of these decorators corresponds to an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and allows you to define a route for your API.

    - Endpoints are the specific URLs that your API responds to, and they consist of the route path and a function that handles the request. For example, `@app.get("/users")` creates a route for the "/users" path and associates it with a function that handles GET requests to that path.

1. **Request and Response Handling:**

    - Request handling in FastAPI is done through function parameters and type hints. FastAPI automatically converts incoming request data to Python objects based on the type hints provided.

    - Response handling is done through the `Response` class, which allows you to customize the response status code, headers, and content.

1. **Path Parameters:** Path parameters allow you to include variables in the route path, which can be accessed in your endpoint function as function parameters. For example, `@app.get("/users/{user_id}")` allows you to access the `user_id` variable in the endpoint function.

1. **Query Parameters:** Query parameters are key-value pairs appended to the URL after a `?` character. They can be accessed in the endpoint function as function parameters. For example, `@app.get("/items")` with a query parameter `?limit=10` can be accessed as `def get_items(limit: int)`. 

1. **Request Bodies:** Request bodies allow you to send JSON data in the body of a request. They can be accessed in the endpoint function using a data model, which is defined using Pydantic's `BaseModel` class.

1. **Response Models:** Response models allow you to specify the structure of the JSON data returned by your API. They are defined using Pydantic's `BaseModel` class and can be used as function return types or as parameters in the `response_model` argument of the route decorators.

1. **Dependency Injection:**
Dependency injection is a design pattern in which the dependencies of a function are provided by the caller rather than being created within the function. In FastAPI, you can use dependency injection to inject dependencies like database connections or authentication tokens into your endpoint functions.


## Advanced Features

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** FastAPI provides built-in support for authentication and authorization. You can use OAuth2, JWT tokens, or other authentication mechanisms to secure your API endpoints. FastAPI also allows you to define permissions and roles to control access to specific endpoints.

1. **Middleware:** Middleware in FastAPI allows you to modify requests and responses at different stages of the request/response lifecycle. This can be useful for adding custom headers, logging, or performing other actions before or after an endpoint handler is executed.

1. **Background Tasks:** FastAPI supports asynchronous background tasks, which allow you to run long-running or asynchronous operations outside of the main request/response cycle. This can be useful for tasks like sending emails, processing data, or performing other operations that don't need to be completed immediately.

1. **WebSockets:** FastAPI supports WebSockets, allowing you to create real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. This can be useful for applications that require real-time updates or push notifications.

1. **Dependency Management:** FastAPI provides built-in support for dependency injection, allowing you to easily manage dependencies and inject them into your endpoint handlers. This can be useful for managing database connections, authentication, or other shared resources.

1. **Custom Response Handling:** FastAPI allows you to customize how responses are handled by defining custom response models. This can be useful for adding custom headers, status codes, or other response metadata.


## Integrations

1. **Database Integration:** FastAPI seamlessly integrates with popular databases such as SQLAlchemy and Tortoise-ORM for efficient data management. These integrations allow you to define database models, perform CRUD operations, and interact with the database within your FastAPI application.

1. **OpenAPI and Swagger UI Integration:** FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI schema for your application, providing detailed documentation of your API endpoints. Additionally, it includes built-in support for Swagger UI, allowing you to visualize and interact with your API documentation in a user-friendly interface.

1. **FastAPI with Asynchronous Libraries:** FastAPI is designed to leverage asynchronous programming paradigms, making it compatible with asynchronous libraries like asyncio and aiohttp. You can utilize the `async` and `await` keywords to create asynchronous endpoints, enabling high-performance and scalable applications.

1. **Testing FastAPI Applications:** FastAPI provides built-in testing utilities for writing and executing tests for your application. You can use libraries such as Pytest or the built-in `TestClient` to perform unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests on your FastAPI endpoints. These testing frameworks enable you to ensure the correctness and reliability of your FastAPI application.


## Best Practices

### Project structure
- Use a modular and organized directory structure.
- Split your application into logical components (e.g., routes, models, services, etc.).
- Consider using a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for larger projects.
- Separate configuration from code and use environment variables for sensitive information.
- Use dependency injection for cleaner and more modular code.

### Error handling
- Implement error handling middleware to catch and handle exceptions globally.
- Use FastAPI's built-in exception handling features for handling common HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request, etc.).
- Provide meaningful error messages to clients to help them understand what went wrong.
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### Security considerations
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth2 or JWT tokens.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between clients and servers.
- Implement input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Keep dependencies up to date to address security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- Use secure cookies and tokens for session management.

### Performance optimization
- Use asynchronous programming to improve performance, especially for I/O-bound operations.
- Use caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database queries.
- Optimize database queries by using indexes, query optimization, and batching.
- Consider using a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
- Use serverless or containerization for scalable and efficient deployment.

### Documentation
- Write clear and concise documentation for each endpoint and API operation.
- Use OpenAPI and Swagger UI integration for generating interactive API documentation.
- Include information about request and response formats, expected status codes, and usage examples.
- Document any external dependencies or third-party services used in your application.
- Keep documentation up to date as the application evolves.
